## Glass2k
Glass2k is very good if you like a linux based system where your windows can be transparent. By downloading Glass@k from your broswer you then need to follow these steps:
* Go to https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/glass2k.html and download the .exe file.
* Execute the file and make your configurations on how you want them to be. 
As of myself i like to change my transparency with Alt + RightClick. 
I put my windows at 90% transparency.
