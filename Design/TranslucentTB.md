## TranslucentTB
Transulent is amazing if you want to customize your taskbar. You can make it transparent, colorful or edit the widgets. 
You simply just need to install it and then go to Hidden ICONS and then set the features you need. 
As of now the default styling is clear meaning there is is no background on your taskbar.
